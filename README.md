Professor of Design and Analysis of Animal Experiments at Federal Universtity of Minas Gerais, Brazil

Welcome!

This is a website to serve as a repository for materials (codes, datasets, programs, etc...) used in the courses I teach at the Veterinary School of the Federal University of Minas Gerais. The material was written to provide programming examples in the courses Data Analysis for Animal Studies, Introduction to Machine Learning - Regression Models, Introduction to Machine Learning - Classification Models, and Design of Animal Studies.
I strongly suggest that you test all codes before use, they were built for academic purposes only. Some issues may remain because the scripts are under continuous development. I will not be responsible for misuse by third parties.

Feel free to browse the page!
