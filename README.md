Welcome!

This is a site to make available all written materials for disciplines taught by me at the Veterinary School of the Federal University of Minas Gerais.
Feel free to browse the page and get all available codes. I strongly suggest that you test and validate all code. Some issues may still remain because the scripts are under continuous development. I am not responsible for misuse by third parties.
The scripts are built to provide programming examples in the courses Data Analysis for Animal Studies, Introduction to Machine Learning - Regression Models, Introduction to Machine Learning - Classification Models and Design of Animal Studies.
